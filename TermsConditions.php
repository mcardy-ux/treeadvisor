                            <br>
                            To help resolve any issues between Us promptly and directly, You and We agree to begin any arbitration within 15 days after a Subject Legal Claim arises; otherwise, the Subject Legal Claim is waived. 
                            <br>
                            In an attempt to find the quickest and most efficient resolution of Our issues, You and We agree to first discuss any issue informally for at least 15 days.

                            You and Us also agree to arbitrate in each of Our individual capacities only, not as a representative or member of a class, and each of Us expressly waives any right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. 
                            <br><br>
                            You may download a form Notice to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
