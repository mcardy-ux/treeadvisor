                                        An automatic sprinkler system is a home improvement project worth considering. 
                                        Not only will it help maintain a healthy beautiful landscape which you can enjoy with your friends and family, 
                                        but it’s the most convenient and efficient way to ensure your landscape gets the water it needs without over or under watering. 
                                        When it is properly installed and maintained an automatic sprinkler system will help conserve water too.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In fact, a professionally or DIY-installed automatic sprinkler system is one of the best investments that you can make for your home.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Keep in mind, however, that there is more to a sprinkler system than just sprinklers.  
                                        System design and installation are critical factors that will affect your system’s performance and longevity. 
                                        If you hire a professional to install your sprinkler system, a system design should be created before installation begins.       
                                        <br><br>
                                        If on the other hand, you decide to install the sprinkler system yourself, TreeAdvisor can create a design plan customized to your landscape’s specific needs.

                                        Irrigation controllers are sometimes called irrigation timers, with a Smart Irrigation System is installed, you’ll never have to drag a hose all over the yard, never have to try and figure out if you’ve applied enough or too much water, 
                                        and you’ll never have to worry about watering the lawn while you’re away. An automatic irrigation system protects that investment by growing healthier, longer living plants and grass. Healthy, well-manicured landscapes will also measurably increase your property’s appraised value and curb appeal.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Controllers are the brains of a sprinkler system. They activate and deactivate designated irrigation zones according to programmed run times. 
                                        Properly programed controllers ensure a landscape is receiving the right amount of water at the optimal watering time. 
                                        Choosing the right controller typically depends on the number of zones needed in a system, and whether or not those zones will be added to or reduced in the future. 
                                        Smart controller which adjusts your watering schedule automatically based on daily weather conditions, resulting in increased water savings throughout the year.

                                        Installing an automatic irrigation system is a complex task. That’s why it is best to hire a qualified professional to design, select, install, and maintain your system. 
                                        Irrigation contractors are experts in hydraulics, proper sprinkler system layout (Head to head coverage), plant water requirements and soil types. Their skills will help ensure a water-efficient system and years of trouble-free operation.

                                        Before You Start a Lawn Seeding Project
                                        <br>
                                        There are a few things to think about to help your grass get off to a good start:
                                        <br><br>
                                        <ul class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                            <li>• A healthy lawn needs good soil. Most turf grasses prefer neutral soils. 
                                                To be sure that your efforts aren’t in vain, always perform a soil test first and make the recommended amendments.
                                            </li>
                                            <br>
                                            <li>• Don’t apply a weed preventer (liquid or granular) or use weed and feed fertilizer when planning to mow grass. 
                                                You can control weeds only after you have mowed new grass seedlings at least four times. 
                                                Any weed controls applied when you sow seed will prevent germination or kill immature seedlings.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </p>
                                    <h5 class="content-2 heading-content-box" style="color:#348e38 !important;">Grass Types</h5>
                                        <p class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                                Before seeding, first identify the type of turf currently growing in your lawn. If starting from scratch, select a turf type suited to grow in your region, and remember the specific requirements of your yard.
                                            <br><br>
                                                Grass seed labels describe characteristics of the grass, such as amount of daylight, hardiness and moisture requirements. Turf grasses are either cool-season grasses or warm-season grasses. In general, where you live determines your lawn type.
                                            <br><br>
                                                In addition to reading the label, there should be a coverage chart to help you determine how much seed you’ll need for your application. Also look to for information on the drop rate for your model of spreader.
                                            <br><br>
                                                In addition to planting pure seed, blends and mixes are also available. A blend is a combination of two or more cultivars of the same species — for example two types of fescue. A mix is a combination of different species of grasses. Both blends and mixes are formulated for specific regions and needs, using the most desirable traits of each grass type to improve the lawn.
                                            <br><br>
                                        </p>
                                    <h5 class="content-2 heading-content-box" style="color:#348e38 !important;">Other Considerations</h5>
                                        <p class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                                You’ll apply the seed with a broadcast spreader or hand spreader. The coverage rates vary based on the type of seed you choose.
                                            <br><br>
                                                Read the label carefully on all lawn-care products. Make sure that the pre- or post-emergent herbicides and fertilizers you purchase are approved for use on your type of grass. Consider how you use your lawn. If you have a lot of foot traffic or children playing, look for a lawn seed with a high traffic tolerance listed. Play areas, especially under swings and other play equipment, also need a tougher turf.
                                        </p>
                                    <h5 class="content-2 heading-content-box" style="color:#348e38 !important;">If you prefer Sod</h5>
                                        <p class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                                Whether you’re doing sod installation yourself, or using a professional landscaper, it is helpful to know what is involved. If you choose to have a sod installation company install your sod, it is good to have an idea of what the installers should be doing so you know how to choose the right landscape installation company for you.

                                            <strong>Step 1: Test the Soil</strong>
                                            <br>
                                                The first step we recommend is testing your soil—before you apply chemicals to kill off your old grass and before you install the new sod. Your soil’s health is what determines the overall health of your grass. Working from the ground up is the best way to ensure superior grass quality.
                                                <br><br>
                                            <strong>Step 2: Choose the Turf</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            Selecting the kind of turf grass you want in your lawn is probably one of the most enjoyable parts. You don’t want to just pick a grass that is aesthetically appealing to the eye though—make sure the grass you select fits the environment and climate you live in and matches the right amount of maintenance and time you want to put into it. Here is a list of some things to do and think about before selecting a new turf grass:
                                            </p>
                                                <ul class="desc-content-box text-decs"> 
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>•Research the area and climate you are located in.</strong>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>•Familiarize yourself with the different grass characteristics.</strong>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>•Understand the visual differences between grass colors, textures and other physical aspects.</strong>
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                            <strong>Step 3: Measure the planting area</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            Make sure you know the square footage of the area that’s going to be soded, this will be good to do it earlier in the project so you know your square footage for chemical applications and fertilizing.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Step 4: Kill, remove all grass and weeds</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            Before you install new sod, it is important to clear the area of any currently existing grass, vegetation or debris in the area you want to replace with new sod. If you are removing grass, we recommend following these steps:

                                            <strong>Step 5: Soil preparation</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            Proper site preparation makes it easier for new grass roots to penetrate deeply and evenly. Deep roots will make the lawn more dense and drought resistant, allowing for more efficient use of water and nutrients. A dense lawn will out-compete weeds and resists insects and disease a little better.

                                            <strong>Step 6: Lay out the new sod</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            Once you have done all of the preparation work, it is now time to have your sod delivered and installed. Be sure to have the grass off the pallet and in your lawn in 48 hours or less. When laying out the new sod, it is recommended to follow these tips:
                                            <br>
                                            <ul class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                                <li><strong>• Plan on where the sod will be delivered and place it in a convenient location in your yard.</strong></li>
                                                <li><strong>• Use wheel barrels to help transport slabs to where you’re working as you move around.</strong></li>
                                                <li><strong>• Plan on having the appropriate amount of people handy to help out with labor.</strong></li>
                                                <li><strong>• Have the right hand tools, such as utility knife box-cutter to cut oddly shaped pieces to fit around curbs or other landscaping.</strong></li>
                                                <li><strong>• Use a brick pattern when laying with offsetting seams.</strong></li>
                                                <li><strong>• Place the pieces together as tightly as possible and use a lawn roller to prevent air packets and weeds from pushing through the seams and to retain moisture.</strong></li>
                                            </p>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="desc-content-box text-decs">
                                            <strong>Step 7: Water & Fertilize</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            During sod installation, it is essential that turf be watered thoroughly. Soak upon installation as water is needed to keep your grass from drying out. 
                                            Select a fertilizer that provides the necessary nutrients your soil may need according to the soil analysis results you should’ve received by now. 
                                            We recommend using a stater fertilizer as on your already installed turf. Grow serves to promote healthy root growth of newly installed grass by providing nutrients like phosphorus, potassium and carbon. The soil should be moist three to four inches deep. Overwatering for an extended period of time, however, will severely damage the turf, inducing disease and rotting roots. We recommend installing a smart controller.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Congratulations on your new lawn! The next step in the sod installation process is establishment. Be sure to fallow our lawn care program for proper maintenance practices to help your newly laid sod develop into a thick, established lawn.
